        <h2>Hello everyone</h2>
        <p>My name is Ian Jackson. I started taking the PathwayConnect Courses back in 2021 in an effort to grow more
            spiritually and to continue learning after work. I earned a B.A. and an M.A. at the FSU in Germany and worked
            at the university before being offered to head a language department at a private academy, which I did for about 3.5 years. I started working in Business Administration 3 years ago and now am pursuing a B.Sc. in Applied Technology here at BYU-I. In my free time I love playing music, working out and reading.</p>
        <p>The thing I love the most about BYU-I is the fact that it blends spiritual growth and traditional academic learning. There is no place I'd rather be as I have the strongest conviction that BYU's efforts to share knowledge and education is such a precious opportunity.</p>
        <h3>My Love for Music</h3>
        <p>While you're here, let me share a little bit about why I love playing music. I started playing the guitar when I was about 10 years old. My father, who was a musician, taught me my first chords. 3 years later I started my first band and have been playing in bands ever since. My current band plays covers of pop songs such as "Attention" by Charlie Puth, "Don't Start Now" by Dua Lipa or "Can't Hold us" by Macklemore. The part that I enjoy the most about playing music is when I get to play together with others - in bands, choirs or duos. I believe that listening to someone play or sing is the best way to listen to their soul express itself. So, my invitation would be: Whenever you feel like singing or playing a tune, invite a friend or two to join you.</p>

        <h3>Studying at BYU-I</h3>
        <p>So why study software engineering? In a nutshell: I would love to be able to work remotely. That is probably the biggest selling point. I am currently able to carry out 40% of my job from home. As much as I love the office and its atmosphere being able to work from almost anywhere would be a dream come true.</p> 
        <p>On top of that I have been fascinated with the idea of creating something that is instantly visible. Programming has proven to be not only challenging in the best possible way, but also a way to work creatively and build something that is entirely your own.</p>
        <p>I therefore look forward to this term and in particular to WDD 130 as well as getting to know more of you in person :).</p>
